            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I gas the entire digital media engine for a sports nutrition company called Ph.D. Fitness led by my mentors, Dr. Jim Stoppani & Mike McErlane.
                I love to explore the blurring lines between video media, coding, and motion graphics to help curate truly unique experiences in
                the ever-evolving tech and fitness space.</p>
                
            <p>When I'm not working, I love to spend time in the gym, getting lost in a game world, spending time with my beautiful wife and kid,
                or producing an ambient Hip-Hop instrumental.</p>

            <h4>Goodfellas Quiz App</h4>
            <p>This app was a great way to practice getting comfortable with functions and Jquery selectors. The app keeps score as the user answers
                multiple-choice questions related to my favorite Martian Scorsese movie, Goodfellas and display the score to the user at the end.</p>
            <p class="tech">Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JS</p>
